# CinMood App

## Introduction

This project is a mobile application called **CinMood**, created using Flutter.
The idea of the app is to connect cinema and mood — helping users find movies that match their feelings or emotional state.
Although the app idea includes using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for movie recommendations, this version focuses mainly on the design and interface.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to design an interactive and modern app that presents the idea of mood-based movie recommendations.
It aims to show how users can search, chat, and explore movie content in an easy and enjoyable way.

## Project Overview

The app contains several pages, each one serving a specific purpose:

| File                                                     | Description                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `login.dart`                                             | Login page where users can sign in.                           |
| `HomePage.dart`, `HomePagetwo.dart`, `Homepagethre.dart` | Main pages that display movie categories and recommendations. |
| `FavoritesPage.dart`                                     | Page that shows the user's favorite movies.                   |
| `profil.dart`                                            | Profile page for user details and settings.                   |
| `chat.dart` and `chat2.dart`                             | Chat interface (prepared for future AI integration).          |
| `video.dart`                                             | Displays or plays short movie trailers.                       |
| `begin.dart`                                             | The starting page that introduces the app.                    |
